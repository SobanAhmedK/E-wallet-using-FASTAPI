# Digital Wallet FastAPI Project

## Overview

This FastAPI project is a digital wallet system that allows users to create accounts, manage their financial transactions, and perform various operations related to deposits, withdrawals, and currency management. The project is designed to provide a secure and efficient platform for handling digital financial activities.

## Features

- **User Management**: Users can create accounts, update their profile information, and manage their login credentials.

- **Member Management**: Members can be added to the system, and their information is securely stored. Members are associated with specific countries.

- **Country Information**: Information about countries is stored, including their names.

- **Currency Support**: The system supports multiple currencies, and their exchange rates are tracked. Currency information is linked to member profiles.

- **Deposits and Withdrawals**: Users can make deposits and withdrawals, and transaction details are recorded for auditing purposes.

- **Gateway Integration**: Deposits are processed through various gateways, and gateway information is maintained.

- **Transaction Logs**: Comprehensive logs of all financial transactions are kept, ensuring transparency and accountability.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

- **API Endpoints**: The FastAPI application defines various API endpoints to handle user authentication, member management, financial transactions, and more.

- **Database Models**: SQLAlchemy models represent the database structure, including user data, member information, country details, and transaction records.

- **Schemas**: Pydantic schemas are used for data validation, serialization, and deserialization when handling HTTP requests and responses. These schemas ensure that data is properly formatted and adheres to validation rules.

- **Database Configuration**: The database connection and session handling are configured using SQLAlchemy and SQLAlchemy sessions.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a Python environment and install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Configure the database connection in the `database.py` file by updating the `SQLALCHEMY_DB_URL` variable with your database URL.
4. Run the FastAPI application using `uvicorn main:app --reload`.

## Usage

## Deployment

This project can be deployed to a production environment by following these steps:

1. Set up a production-ready database server.

2. Configure environment variables for sensitive information, such as database credentials and secret keys.

3. Use a production-grade web server, such as Gunicorn, to serve the FastAPI application.

4. Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) to handle incoming HTTP requests and forward them to the FastAPI application.

5. Implement security measures, such as HTTPS, to protect data in transit.

6. Monitor and maintain the deployed application to ensure its availability and performance.
